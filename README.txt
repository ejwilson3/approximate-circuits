Scripts for generating and running approximate circuits, as well as an example script for analyzing the results.

The script generate_circuits.py is used to create approximate circuits using QSearch or QFast from BSQKit (https://bqskit.lbl.gov/). It uses QSearch (wich only works with the modifications in the repository here: https://github.com/ejwilson3/qsearch) for circuits with 3 or fewer qubits, and QFast for more. Using a circuit with more than 6 qubits is not recommended.
It creates a directory called output_name and fills it with qasm files called output_name#.qasm in sequential order.

Usage: python generate_circuits.py reference.qasm [output_name]


The script run_circuits.py is used to run all of those circuits and analyze them for depth. It is set up to read the circuits generated by generate_circuits.py, and should be given the same qasm. It also needs a number of synthesized circuits to analyze.
This script has many variables which can be changed to change parameters in a highlighted area, for whether it should be simulated or run on a real machine, how many shots are to be used, the optimization level used by the transpiler, and details on the ibmq machine to be used (or to create the noise model).
This script is set up to take reference.qasm with no measurement; another highlighted area should be commented out if this is not the case.
It outputs a file called synthesis_directory.counts.txt which is full of the cnot counts and result dictionaries.
If the 'simulated' variable is set to false, it likewise puts out a file called synthesis_directory.backupJobIDs.txt to keep track of the jobs run in case they need to be inspected for other information at another time.

Usage: python run_circuits.py reference.qasm synthesis_directory num_files


The script js_chart.py is an example script which uses the synthesis_directory.counts.txt file to create a chart using the Jensen Shannon distance between a circuit and the reference run on a simulator without noise as the metric of comparison.
It creates charts of the same kind used for the Toffoli inspection in the paper.

Usage: python js_chart.py synthesis_directory
